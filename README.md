About Data used in the journal manuscript 'An assessment of extra-tropical cyclone precipitation extremes over the Southern Hemisphere using ERA5'

Main Figures:

Figure 1 was created using the .nc file 'precipitation_occurrence' containing the occurrence data for the wet day precipitation and cyclone composites masked by the 50th, 90th and 98th percentiles, across the deepening, peak intensity and decay phases. Arrays for radii and angles used to plot are also given. 

Figure 2 was similarly created using the .nc file 'precipitation_fraction' containing the fraction data for the wet day precipitation and cyclone composites masked by the 50th, 90th and 98th percentiles, across the deepening, peak intensity and decay phases. Arrays for radii and angles used to plot are also given.

Figure 3 was made using the data from Figures 1 and 2.
